pg_arman
========

pg_arman is a backup and recovery manager for PostgreSQL servers able to do
differential and full backup as well as restore a cluster to a
state defined by a given recovery target. It is designed to perform
periodic backups of an existing PostgreSQL server, combined with WAL
archives to provide a way to recover a server in case of failure of
server because of a reason or another. Its differential backup
facility reduces the amount of data necessary to be taken between
two consecutive backups.

Download
--------

The latest version of this software can be found on the project website at
https://github.com/michaelpq/pg_arman.

Installation
------------

Compiling pg_arman requires a PostgreSQL installation to be in place
as well as a raw source tree. Pass the path to the PostgreSQL source tree
to make, in the top_srcdir variable:

    make USE_PGXS=1 top_srcdir=<path to PostgreSQL source tree>

In addition, you must have pg_config in $PATH.

The current version of pg_arman is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.5 and
upper versions.

Platforms
---------

pg_arman has been tested on Linux and Unix-based platforms.

Documentation
-------------

All the documentation is maintained in doc/ as text file, that is then
fetched by asciidoc to generate automatically man pages and html
documentation.

In order to generate the documentation, the variables XMLTO and ASCIIDOC
need to be set to proper values indicating where are located the binaries
of respectively xmlto and asciidoc. An example of build is as follows:

    make top_srcdir=<path to PostgreSQL source tree> \
        ASCIIDOC=asciidoc XMLTO=xmlto

They could as well be set as environment variables for development
purposes.

On OSX, it is necessary to set XML_CATALOG_FILES to point to the correct
xml catalogs. In the case of an environment with Homebrew after having
install xmlto and asciidoc:

    export XML_CATALOG_FILES="/usr/local/etc/xml/catalog"

Regression tests
----------------

The test suite of pg_arman is available in the code tree and can be
launched in a way similar to common PostgreSQL extensions and modules:

    make installcheck
