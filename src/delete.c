 * Purge WAL archive.  One timeline at a time.
 * If 'keep_lsn' is InvalidXLogRecPtr, then whole timeline can be purged
 * If 'keep_lsn' is valid LSN, then every lesser segment can be purged.
 * If 'dry_run' is set, then don`t actually delete anything.
 *
 * Case 1:
 *	archive is not empty, 'keep_lsn' is valid and we can delete something.
 * Case 2:
 *	archive is not empty, 'keep_lsn' is valid and prevening us from deleting anything.
 * Case 3:
 * 	archive is not empty, 'keep_lsn' is invalid, drop all WAL files in archive,
 *												 belonging to the timeline.
 * Case 4:
 * 	archive is empty, 'keep_lsn' is valid, assume corruption of WAL archive.
 * Case 5:
 * 	archive is empty, 'keep_lsn' is invalid, drop backup history files
 *  and partial WAL segments in archive.
 *
 * Q: Maybe we should stop treating partial WAL segments as second-class citizens?
